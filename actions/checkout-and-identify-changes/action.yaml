  Compares two commits to find modified yaml files.
  The resulting list of modified/added files is written to `modified-yaml-files.txt`.

    description: Source folder containing yaml files to analyze
    required: true
  destination:
    description: Relative destination folder to which the files of the newer commit are checked out.
    required: true
outputs: {}
